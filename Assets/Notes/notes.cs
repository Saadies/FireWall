    NewIdea:
    Enemies that don't "attack" and give extra points or health

    rats:
    standing rats jump once over fire then walk

    Ideas:


    differentiate levels by changing background (and eyes)
    no score in story -> consciousness level (0 - 100 %) with brighter getting brain icon

    make it more friendly and stupid so you can switch to dark as a surprise
    ascii enemies with shader shield

    call it firewall XP and make the endboss an XP smiley.
    maybe later you can develope more AI enbosses build on emojis (dlc)

    


    3D Animated eyes as evolving character (sleeping till boss 1)
    fire!wall as hitbox
    difference enemies by glowing weakpoint
        glowing disk front -> wall  capsule
        glowing dot center -> tap   circle
        glowing line through sprite-> slice     cube
    skill upgrades: two walls simultanously
    skill upgrade two: hold "tap" for lines of dot enemies
    skill upgrade three : angled slice ? freeze enemies at first contact ?

    slice through firewall for limited bombs
    bomb pickups, gesture? two taps? glowing dot with ring around that disappears after first tap

    enemies have to be simple. semi-rare flavor text when killing an enemy?

    ATTACK PATTERNS: (Crafted in story, challenge will have seeds and random sections)
        - chross and arced cross worms of enemies that have a point where all meet
        - enemy that bounces


    only the awoken may challenge themselves
    play -> start dreaming
    customize locked until first free unlock

    bosses:
        tap to shoot
        circles for bombs /other color
        glowing weakpoints
        bosses have non-random attack patterns
        bosses can defend with walls sometimes
        3 bosses + endboss? (collect 3 artifactes -> defeat evil)
            hard bosses , ads before boss and every 3 deaths (corruption value = 100% -> ads)
            1: Spamboss/Scammer 2: facebook (data collector) 3: NSA (censoring) freedomtaker | boss: black hat AI (you are white hat AI)
        10 minutes in level between bosses (5 levels total a 2min ?) maybe 6 and after 3 skill upgrade?

    level plus: different colored ai (random, some eye variation)
        seamless levels (but actual ones in background)
        randomized levels for arcade mode? level plus after endgame.
        start arcade mode at level and continue
        start arcade mode and stay at lvel
        start arcade mode at game plus difficulty

    score system. "No hit" Story give a crown or something for your avatar(eyes, glowing?) 

	fun levels between normals one where you get a huge amount of enemies but loose no life
	
    "profile" button for customization "hello profile"

    nice to have:
    (monthly) challenges with highscore (currency to personalize your name/banner in list) kinda like slay the spire

    level editor :O

	next game ideas
	- whack a mole but you drag back from a central point in any direction, it could bounce the opposite way back to create more fun
	- lane based turn based (pokemon-light)"rpg" ... with wizards and elements pls
	- mobile katamari damacy but for mobile you are a black hole, 3d but with sprites?, maybe isometric with up/down button. maybe you can drag and push (4 "buttons") . make fun movement withour shitty digital pads
	- mobile pinball, the ball is enlarged at the bottom and you can choose direction depending on where you tap. a highlighted area bar at the bottom of the level indicates when your taps work, sooner = harder
	- mobile fighting game, left side 3 buttons vertical for blocking (up/middle/down)/maybe jump/duck/block? and right side 3 buttons for attack (up/middle/down) no moving.

    vr:
    controlling a mech that has a lot of buttons and levers and you have to do simple task (construction, rescue mission, intro level could be a show where you have to do what the presenter says)
        handposition is hovering ball/on shoulder or just position same as body, fingers are sliders,  hand rotation  2 levers
        upper and lower buddy are seperated, tv screen with third person view.
        upper lower buddy rotation are horizontal "wheels" (embedded)
        squatting/crouch could be one button, bücken second button
