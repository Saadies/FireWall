# FireWall
A game with two gameplay scenes. One allows you to draw a line with a max length that destroys enemies coming towards. The other has 3(expanding to 4) crossbows you can tap to destroy other enemies coming towards you. This was my first real effort at a (mobile) game but I didn't think the wall thing was as fun as I imagined. I used some scripts to start Neon Sling, which is also an arcade game but seems much more fun and is already far further developed.
