# FireWall
A game with two gameplay scenes. One allows you to draw a line with a max length that destroys enemies coming towards. 
The other has 3(expanding to 4) crossbows you can tap to destroy other enemies coming towards you. 

This was my first real effort at a (mobile) game but I didn't think the wall thing was as fun as I imagined. I used some scripts to start Neon Sling, which is also an arcade game but seems much more fun and is already far further developed.


Working (kinda) with Unity 2019.1(.5)

You can try the game at: http://nsproto.saadies.com/

Level 1 adds new attacks until you beat the rat boss. (A Ball of rats sending them out until all are left)
Level 2 will also add attcks but after the fourth crossbow moves back outside the intended playarea the enemies will spawn randomly forever.

The (aspect) camera doesn't work right on the web build, it should be 9:16 perspective portrait mode but you can see left and right outside the play area.
Doesn't change much in Level 2 except that you can see (and use) the fourth crossbow.
In Level 1 the rats will spawn outside the intended area but you can draw walls there as well.
Should be enough to see if there might be anything useful for you.
